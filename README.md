## What is that?

This project is a challenge made by [devgrid](http://devgrid.co.uk).

# Introduction

The goals of the challenge are:

* Provision an instance from scratch using Terraform on a cloud provider of your choice (Digital Ocean or AWS);
* Install and configure a CI/CD tool of your choice in this new VM using Ansible;
* Configure a push deploy pipeline with the CI/CD tool with these repositories:
  * https://github.com/devgrid/calculator-service
  * https://github.com/devgrid/calculator-service-test

* **The main idea is that you do it yourself, if you don't, we will know.**

## Starting point

There are good examples of creating different resources using terraform and ansible.

* https://github.com/terraform-providers
